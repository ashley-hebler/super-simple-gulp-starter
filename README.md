# super-simple-gulp-starter


1. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Install node</a>

2. Did it work? Check with: `node -v` and then `npm -v`

3. Install gulp globally `npm install -g gulp` to use on this and other projects. Not sure if you have it? Check with: `gulp -v`

4. Clone this directory - `cd` into the folder where you want it to live and run:

`git clone https://github.com/ashley-hebler/super-simple-gulp-starter.git`

5. `cd super-simple-gulp-starter`

6. `npm install`

7. `gulp`

8. Edit the `scss/style.scss` to see the CSS compile into `css/style.css`. FYI: `ctrl + c` quits the gulp process.
